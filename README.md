#This is kinda pushed, but something to put in practice. :D

## Happy b-day <3

<em>
Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is ok
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me
Take me on
I'll be gone
In a day or two
In a day or two
